# CAMP – Campus Asset Management Platform

## Product Vision Statement

For students and campus staff who struggle with fragmented systems and manual processes for borrowing and managing equipment, **CAMP (Campus Asset Management Platform)** is a mobile-friendly web application that centralizes the borrowing, reserving, and tracking of campus assets across facilities such as the IM Lab, Arts Centre, and Library.  

Unlike traditional or department-specific systems that rely on spreadsheets or manual logging, **CAMP** unifies all campus inventories under one platform, enabling real-time availability checks, automated notifications, and secure, transparent transactions — ultimately improving convenience, accountability, and efficiency across the university.

---

## Project Description

University campuses often manage hundreds of items from cameras and lab kits to musical instruments and sports gear using disjointed or manual systems. This leads to misplaced assets, missed deadlines, and communication breakdowns between students and staff. CAMP solves these issues by offering a centralized, intelligent platform where students can easily reserve and borrow items, and staff can efficiently track inventory, manage returns, and monitor overdue items.

---

## Key Features

- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Seamless login with university NetID credentials.  
- **Centralized Inventory Management:** Unified view of all available items across departments and facilitis.  
- **Pre-Booking System:** Students can reserve items in advance with transparent availability.  
- **Real-Time Notifications:**  
  - Automated reminders before due dates.  
  - Alerts for overdue returns.  
  - Notifications when desired items become available again.  
- **Payment Integration:** Secure campus cash system for deposits, fines, or fees.  
- **Ratings & Reviews:** Students can provide feedback on both equipment and staff service quality.  
- **Cross-Platform Access:** Fully responsive web app accessible via mobile, tablet, or desktop.  

---

## Who Is This For?

**CAMP** is designed for all campus community members who interact with shared resources, particularly:

- **Students:** Borrowing cameras, laptops, lab kits, or sports gear.  
- **Staff:** Managing item issuance, returns, and inventory across multiple departments.  
- **Facility Managers:** Overseeing equipment usage, statistics, and accountability campus-wide.  

---

##  Example Use Case

A photography student needs a DSLR camera for a weekend project. Using **CAMP**, they log in with their NetID, browse available items, and reserve a camera from the Arts Centre. They receive automated reminders before pickup and return deadlines. Meanwhile, staff can view real-time borrowing records, send overdue alerts, and track all transactions in one dashboard with no need for spreadsheets or manual emails.

## Project History

**CAMP** was born out of a shared observation: many university facilities rely on separate or outdated systems for asset management. This leads to inefficiency, confusion, and wasted time for both students and staff.  

Our team set out to create a unified, easy-to-use platform that not only simplifies borrowing and reservations but also automates the most tedious parts of the process like reminders and overdue tracking while keeping data secure and transparent.  

By centralizing inventory data and integrating modern features like SSO, payment processing, and notifications, **CAMP** aims to become the campus-wide standard for asset management and resource sharing.

##  Contributing

We welcome contributions to **CAMP!** Please refer to our `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for detailed guidelines on:

- Team norms and coding conventions  
- Development workflow and Git branching strategy  
- Local setup instructions for backend and frontend environments  
- How to test, submit pull requests, and report issues  

---

##  Building and Testing

Details will be updated as the project progresses to the development and deployment phase. Planned tools and frameworks include:

- **Frontend:** React (with Tailwind CSS for UI)  
- **Backend:** Flask or Node.js  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or Firebase  
- **Authentication:** University SSO integration  
- **Hosting:** Campus servers or AWS Cloud

##  What Makes This Feasible

**CAMP** is designed as a modular, scalable platform. The core reservation and tracking system serves as a foundation upon which advanced features like payment integration, analytics dashboards, or cross-department syncing can be incrementally added.  

The modular architecture ensures that each new feature can be developed independently without disrupting the base functionality — keeping the project both manageable and sustainable.

---

## What Makes This Appropriately Challenging

Developing **CAMP** involves tackling real-world software engineering challenges such as:

- Designing a **multi-role user system** (students vs. staff) with different permissions.  
- Implementing **real-time item availability and notifications**.  
- Ensuring **data consistency** across multiple departments and assets.  
- Integrating **secure authentication** (SSO) and **payment systems**.  
- Delivering a **mobile-first UI** that remains intuitive despite complex functionality.  

These challenges make **CAMP** both a technically engaging and impactful project that directly benefits the university community.

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a fast build tool for modern web applications.  
It uses **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript (ES6)** for the front-end.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload automatically when you make changes to the code.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.  
It optimizes and bundles your React components for best performance.  

Your app is now ready to be deployed!

### `npm run preview`

Previews the production build locally.  
This is useful to test your app before deploying it.

### `npm install`

Installs all required dependencies listed in `package.json`.  
You only need to run this once before running or building the app.
