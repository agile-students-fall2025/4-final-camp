This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a fast build tool for modern web applications.  
It uses **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript (ES6)** for the front-end.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload automatically when you make changes to the code.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.  
It optimizes and bundles your React components for best performance.  

Your app is now ready to be deployed!

### `npm run preview`
