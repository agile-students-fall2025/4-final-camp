## 🧭 Team Norms

### Team Values
- **Respect:** Every voice matters; treat all feedback constructively.  
- **Communication:** Keep updates open and transparent.  
- **Collaboration:** Support teammates and review code with care.

## 🔁 Git Workflow

We follow the **Feature Branch Workflow**.

### Branch Naming
Use the format:  
`<type>/<short-description>`

Examples:
feature/add-login
fix/resolve-overdue-alert
docs/update-readme

perl
Copy code

### Commit Messages
Follow the format:
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`  
**Scope:** The component/feature affected (optional but recommended)  
**Subject:** Brief description of the change  
**Example:** `feat(auth): implement JWT refresh token endpoint`

### Workflow Steps
```bash
# Create and checkout a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/add-dashboard

# Make your changes and commit regularly
git add .
git commit -m "feat(dashboard): add staff dashboard UI"

# Push to remote
git push origin feature/add-dashboard

# Open a Pull Request on GitHub
# All PRs go to the master branch
```

## ⚙️ Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+ and npm v9+
- MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB 6.0+)
- Git
- VS Code (recommended)

### Setup Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/agile-students-fall2025/4-final-camp.git
cd 4-final-camp
```

**Backend Setup:**
```bash
cd back-end
npm install

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your MongoDB Atlas credentials
nano .env

# Start development server
npm start
```

**Frontend Setup:**
```bash
cd ../front-end
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev
```

### Environment Configuration

**Backend `.env` example:**
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster.mongodb.net/camp
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=8081
```

**Frontend `.env` example:**
```env
REACT_APP_USE_MOCK=false
REACT_APP_API_BASE=/api
```

### Default URLs
- **Frontend:** http://localhost:3001
- **Backend:** http://localhost:8081
- **API Health Check:** http://localhost:8081/health

## 💻 Coding Standards

### JavaScript & Node.js
- Use ES6+ syntax (const/let, arrow functions, destructuring)
- Prefer async/await over callbacks or promise chains
- Use meaningful variable names (camelCase)
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- Add JSDoc comments for functions and complex logic

### React & Frontend
- Use functional components with React hooks exclusively
- Use PascalCase for component names
- Keep component files focused (one component per file when possible)
- Use meaningful prop names and include prop validation
- Extract reusable components to reduce duplication

### Backend Express.js
- Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns (auth, validation, logging)
- Keep route handlers clean; move business logic to models/services
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Return consistent JSON error responses

### Formatting & Linting

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd front-end
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
```

**Backend:**
Code should follow project conventions. Run tests to catch issues:
```bash
cd back-end
npm test
```

- Address feedback and push updates to the same branch
- Once approved, maintainer will merge using "Squash and Merge"
- Delete the feature branch after merging

## 🧪 Building and Testing

### Running Tests

**Backend Tests:**
```bash
cd back-end
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:coverage      # Run with coverage report
npm test -- auth.test.js   # Run specific test file
```

**Frontend Build:**
```bash
cd front-end
npm run build              # Create production build
npm run lint               # Check code quality
```

### Test Coverage
- Backend tests use Mocha, Chai, and Supertest
- Aim for >80% code coverage on critical paths
- All new features should include corresponding tests
- Backend has 9 test suites covering major functionality

### CI/CD Pipeline
**Our project includes automated CI/CD:**
- **CI:** Runs on every PR (tests, linting, build)
- **CD:** Deploys to production on merge to master
- Configuration in `.github/workflows/`
